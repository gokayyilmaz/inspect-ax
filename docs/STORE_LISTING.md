# Inspect AX - Final Listing Copy

## Chrome Web Store Title

Inspect AX

## Short Description

Right-click any element and instantly inspect accessible Role and Name in a lightweight popup.

## Full Description

Inspect AX makes accessibility spot-checks faster in Chrome.

Instead of opening DevTools and navigating multiple sections, right-click any element and choose `Inspect AX`.
A compact popup appears near your cursor and shows the two most useful accessibility fields:

- Role
- Name

Inspect AX is designed for speed during QA, debugging, and audits.

### Key Features

- One-click context menu action (`Inspect AX`)
- Inline popup near pointer
- Copy value by click or by selecting text
- Quick `Copied` feedback message
- Dismiss with outside click or `Escape`
- Light and dark theme support

### Technical Notes

- When computed accessibility APIs are unavailable, values may be inferred from semantic HTML and ARIA attributes.
- On some iframe-heavy pages, element resolution can fail.

### Privacy

Inspect AX runs locally in your browser and does not transmit inspected page content to external servers.
